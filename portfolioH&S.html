                        <br>
                        This was a part-time career I took up during breaks between semesters, in which I would care for and assist various clients with developmental disabilities in daily scheduled programs with occasional trips to locations in the community, such as the local zoo or park. In preparation, I was also certified by the American Red Cross in Adult and Child CPR/First Aid (06/20/2018 with a validity period of 2 years), enabling me to administer and chart various medication treatments for clients. I assisted clients to lead a self-directed life and contribute to the community through scheduled activities, guided-personalized behavioral development plans, education development plans, and volunteer work.
